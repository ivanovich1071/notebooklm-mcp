## [1.1.2-http] - 2025-01-21

### Added

**HTTP REST API Wrapper:**
- Express.js server exposing the MCP API via HTTP REST
- 8 documented REST endpoints (see [docs/03-API.md](./docs/03-API.md))
- CORS support for n8n/Zapier/Make integration
- Network configuration via environment variables (`HTTP_HOST`, `HTTP_PORT`)
- Listening on `0.0.0.0` by default for network access
- Enhanced logs with version, configuration, and available endpoints

**Complete Documentation:**
- Step-by-step installation guide ([docs/01-INSTALL.md](./docs/01-INSTALL.md))
- Configuration and security guide ([docs/02-CONFIGURATION.md](./docs/02-CONFIGURATION.md))
- Complete API reference ([docs/03-API.md](./docs/03-API.md))
- n8n integration guide with workflows ([docs/04-N8N-INTEGRATION.md](./docs/04-N8N-INTEGRATION.md))
- Troubleshooting guide ([docs/05-TROUBLESHOOTING.md](./docs/05-TROUBLESHOOTING.md))
- Quick start guide ([QUICK-START.md](./QUICK-START.md))
- Navigation index ([INDEX.md](./INDEX.md))

**PowerShell Automation Scripts:**
- `scripts/install.ps1` - Automated installation with checks
- `scripts/start-server.ps1` - Startup with pre-checks
- `scripts/stop-server.ps1` - Clean server shutdown
- `scripts/test-server.ps1` - Validation tests (health, notebooks, ask)

**Deployment Package:**
- Isolated and clean `deployment/` directory
- `PACKAGE-FILES.txt` file listing required files
- Ready for distribution via Git or npm

### Fixed

**Critical Bug - Windows Authentication:**
- **Issue:** chrome_profile/ remained empty after Google authentication
- **Cause:** Windows filesystem does not immediately flush writes
- **Solution:** Added a 5-second delay before closing Chrome
- **File:** `src/auth/auth-manager.ts` line 966
- **Impact:** Persistent authentication now works on Windows

**Bug - Streaming Detection:**
- **Issue:** Truncated responses or placeholders returned ("Getting the context...")
- **Cause:** Stability threshold too low (3 polls) and missing NotebookLM placeholders
- **Solution:**
  - Added NotebookLM placeholders ("getting the context", "loading", "please wait")
  - Increased stability threshold to 8 polls (~8 seconds)
- **File:** `src/utils/page-utils.ts` lines 51-53 and 210
- **Impact:** Complete and reliable responses (tested up to 5964 characters)

**Bug - System Text in Responses:**
- **Issue:** Each response contained "\n\nEXTREMELY IMPORTANT: Is that ALL you need..."
- **Cause:** `FOLLOW_UP_REMINDER` constant added after text cleanup
- **Solution:** Removed the constant and its usage
- **File:** `src/tools/index.ts` lines 30-31 and 791
- **Impact:** Clean responses, only NotebookLM content

### Changed

**Log Improvements:**
- Added server version in startup banner
- Display of configuration (Host, Port, network accessibility)
- List of available endpoints at startup
- Colored and structured logs via `utils/logger.ts`
- Format: `log.success()`, `log.info()`, `log.warning()`, `log.error()`, `log.dim()`

**Configuration:**
- Documented and standardized environment variables
- `.env` support with dotenv (optional)
- Sane defaults: `HTTP_HOST=0.0.0.0`, `HTTP_PORT=3000`, `HEADLESS=true`

**Compatibility:**
- Maintained 100% compatibility with original MCP stdio mode
- No breaking changes to existing features
